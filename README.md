# SmartAccessSystem
MinorProject's Code
This project outlines the design and implementation of an RFID-based door access control system with integrated smoke detection sensor and automatic light opener for a room. The system utilizes RFID technology to grant access to authorized individuals using a RFID tag or phone via WIFI and ESP-32 microcontroller, while the smoke detection sensor ensures the safety of the building by detecting smoke and triggering the notification. The automatic light opener is triggered by the RFID system using relay module when an authorized user enters the room, providing convenience and energy efficiency by only illuminating the room when it is occupied. 
The system offers increased security, safety measures and energy efficiency for any facility by implementing access control, fire prevention and automatic light opening capabilities. The integration of RFID technology is easy and can be carried out all the times while the phone-based access option can be carried with the user all the times. The smoke detection sensor and automatic light opener allows for real-time monitoring and control of the building's access points, provides a quick response in case of emergency situations and reduces energy consumption.
